Upgrading
=========
1. Backup the following files from your existing installation:
	- config/core.php
	- config/database.php
	- config/wpkgExpress.php
2. Overwrite the files from your existing installation with the files contained in this distribution
3. Restore your backed up files, overwriting the ones from this distribution
*4. Finally, if upgrading from r11 or older, navigate to the following address in your browser: http://your-server/where-wpkgExpress-is-installed/upgrade_pre-r12.php
   This will upgrade the wpkgExpress configuration file to the new format used by r12 onwards.
